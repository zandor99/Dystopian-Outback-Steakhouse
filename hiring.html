      <p style="font: bold 1em Courier, monospace; color: #e00707; text-align: center;"> Here at Outback Steakhouse, you would be surprised to learn that we are <b>very</b> selective about our employees. <br>
        Employees are required to have at least two years experience hunting small game and demonic entities, and are recommended to have basic knowledge of Arcane rituals. <br>
        Working at Outback Steakhouse comes with great benefits, including a 401k, easy access to forbidden texts on necromancy, and a 35% discount on food. <br>
        However, you will be paid entirely in human souls.<br><br>
        If you're lucky enough to be chosen for this <s> apprenticeship</s> job, then you will have to partake in an eldritch ritual requiring that you pledge the life of your firstborn child to Cthulu. <br> Your uniform will not be paid for.
