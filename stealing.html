      <p style="font: bold 1em Courier, monospace; color: #e00707; text-align: center;"> Because there are "No Rules, Just Right" here at Outback Steakhouse. One of our customers' favorite deals is to just steal the steak. <br>
        You've gotta make sure to be quick, though, because if we catch you, you will be killed and turned into steak.<br>
        Also, customers at Outback can enjoy full immunity from the government, since we are technically considered to be a small nation with no extradition treaties with any other countries.
